# thc_initiationage_psychosis

In this repository you can find the components that were derived in our PRONIA-CIP-publication: "Association between age of cannabis initiation and gray matter
covariance networks in recent onset psychosis" (Penzel et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, in press, 2021).
In our study, we employed group information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) (Luo et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2010) using the GIFT-toolbox (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/). This approach at the same time maximizes independence between the components and minimizes the distance to reference components (components of interest). As we aimed to investigate the effects of the age of cannabis use initiation on brain structures that are reliably associated with schizophrenia we used the 4 components from Gupta et al. (2015) that were significantly different between schizophrenia and healthy controls.
Our main finding was that the age of cannabis initiation was negatively associated with grey matter volume in the COI9_cerebellum in patients with recent onset psychosis, thus greater grey matter volume in the cerebellum (COI9_cerebellum) was associated with an earlier cannabis consume. 

In case of any questions feel free to contact (nora.penzel@gmail.com). 

We want to thank Prof. Vince Calhoun, and Dr. Navin Gupta for sharing their component results with us.
